## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Agent-Driven Analysis and Design (Week 1)

#### Use Claude Code + Planning Agent
```bash
# Claude Code session with architect agent
claude-code --agent architect-agent

"Analyze my project structure and design a context management system:
- Project: [Your Project Details]
- Team Size: [Number]
- Codebase Size: [LOC estimate]
- Main Challenges: [Context loss, session breaks, etc.]
- Preferred Tech Stack: [Python/TypeScript/etc.]

Design a multi-agent context management system with:
1. Context persistence strategy
2. MCP server architecture
3. Integration plan with Claude Code
4. Specific implementation steps"
```

#### Expected Output:
- Detailed system architecture document
- MCP server specifications
- Database schema for context storage
- Integration workflow diagrams

### Phase 2: Automated MCP Server Generation (Week 2)

#### Use MCP Builder Agent
```bash
# Generate context management MCP servers
claude-code --agent mcp-builder

"Based on the architecture from Phase 1, build these MCP servers:

1. Context Storage Server
   - Vector database integration (Chroma/Pinecone)
   - Conversation history persistence
   - Code pattern storage

2. Context Retrieval Server
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Relevance scoring
   - Context window optimization

3. Session Manager Server
   - Session continuity across Claude Code restarts
   - Context restoration
   - Memory synchronization

Use FastMCP framework and include:
- Full Python implementations
- Configuration files
- Installation scripts
- Testing suites"
```

#### Automated Generation Features:
- **FastMCP Integration**: Automatically generates tool definitions from docstrings
- **Vector DB Setup**: Creates embeddings and indexing automatically
- **Configuration Management**: Generates config files for different environments
- **Testing Framework**: Creates automated tests for all MCP functions

### Phase 3: Context Intelligence Layer (Week 3)

#### Use Context Manager Agent
```bash
claude-code --agent context-manager

"Implement intelligent context management logic:

1. Context Prioritization Algorithm
   - Score context relevance based on current task
   - Implement decay functions for old information
   - Create anchor points for critical project info

2. Summarization Engine
   - Compress old conversations while preserving key insights
   - Extract and persist architectural decisions
   - Maintain coding patterns and preferences

3. Predictive Context Loading
   - Anticipate what context will be needed next
   - Pre-load relevant code sections
   - Prepare documentation summaries

Build this as MCP tools that other agents can use."
```

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization (Week 4)

#### Use Integration Agent
```bash
claude-code --agent integration-specialist

"Integrate all components and optimize for Claude Code:

1. MCP Server Deployment
   - Configure Claude Code to use custom MCP servers
   - Set up automatic startup and health monitoring
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

2. Workflow Optimization
   - Create Claude Code aliases for common context operations
   - Build session restoration scripts
   - Implement performance monitoring

3. User Experience Enhancement
   - Create simple commands for context management
   - Build status dashboards
   - Implement usage analytics"
```

## Specific Agent Implementations

### Master Orchestrator Agent

```python
# This agent coordinates all other agents
class ContextSystemOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'architect': ArchitectAgent(),
            'mcp_builder': MCPBuilderAgent(),
            'context_manager': ContextManagerAgent(),
            'integration': IntegrationAgent()
        }
    
    async def build_context_system(self, project_requirements):
        # Phase 1: Architecture
        architecture = await self.agents['architect'].design_system(project_requirements)
        
        # Phase 2: Implementation
        mcp_servers = await self.agents['mcp_builder'].build_servers(architecture)
        
        # Phase 3: Intelligence
        context_logic = await self.agents['context_manager'].implement_intelligence(architecture)
        
        # Phase 4: Integration
        deployment = await self.agents['integration'].deploy_system(mcp_servers, context_logic)
        
        return {
            'architecture': architecture,
            'mcp_servers': mcp_servers,
            'context_logic': context_logic,
            'deployment': deployment
        }
```
