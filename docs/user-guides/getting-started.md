# Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to AI Agent Context Management System

This guide will help you set up and start using the intelligent context management system that learns from your coding patterns and provides cross-project intelligence.

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ A fully functional intelligent context management system
- ‚úÖ Claude Code integrated with cross-project learning
- ‚úÖ Your first project analyzed and patterns extracted
- ‚úÖ Intelligent suggestions based on your coding style
- ‚úÖ Session continuity across Claude Code restarts

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Claude Code CLI** (latest version)
- **Git** for project analysis
- **4GB+ RAM** for optimal performance

### Optional but Recommended
- **Docker** for containerized deployment
- **PostgreSQL** for production database
- **Redis** for session caching

## Quick Start (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Installation

#### Option A: Automated Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ClaudeContextMCP.git
cd ClaudeContextMCP

# Run the automated setup
python scripts/quick_setup.py --interactive
```

The setup script will:
- Install all dependencies
- Configure the database
- Set up MCP servers
- Configure Claude Code integration
- Run initial tests

#### Option B: Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ClaudeContextMCP.git
cd ClaudeContextMCP

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional dependencies for machine learning
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt

# Set up the database
python scripts/setup_database.py

# Configure MCP servers
python scripts/configure_mcp.py
```

### Step 2: Claude Code Configuration

The setup script automatically configures Claude Code, but you can verify:

```bash
# Check if MCP servers are configured
claude-code --list-mcp-servers

# You should see:
# - context-storage (port 8001)
# - retrieval-engine (port 8002) 
# - intelligence-engine (port 8003)
# - session-manager (port 8004)
```

### Step 3: Bootstrap Your First Project

#### For Existing Projects
```bash
# Start Claude Code with the new system
claude-code

# In Claude Code, bootstrap an existing project
/bootstrap-project /path/to/your/existing/project

# The system will:
# - Analyze your git history
# - Extract coding patterns
# - Build your developer profile
# - Set up intelligent context
```

#### For New Projects
```bash
# In Claude Code
/create-intelligent-project
    --name "my-new-app"
    --type "web_app"
    --description "A modern web application"

# The system will:
# - Suggest technology stack based on your patterns
# - Set up project structure using your preferences
# - Apply your established coding conventions
# - Initialize intelligent context management
```

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Test the core features:

```bash
# In Claude Code

# Test context search
/search "authentication implementation"

# Test cross-project suggestions
/find-similar-solution "user management system"

# Test pattern transfer
/suggest-patterns --current-task "API design"

# Test session continuity
# Exit Claude Code and restart - context should restore automatically
```

## Understanding Your Intelligent System

### Developer Profile
Your system builds a comprehensive profile that includes:

#### Technology Preferences
- **Languages**: Python (confidence: 0.9), JavaScript (confidence: 0.7)
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI (confidence: 0.85), React (confidence: 0.8)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (confidence: 0.9), Redis (confidence: 0.7)
- **Tools**: Docker (confidence: 0.8), Git (confidence: 0.95)

#### Architectural Patterns
- **API Design**: RESTful with OpenAPI documentation
- **Database**: Repository pattern with ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Error Handling**: Centralized exception handling

#### Coding Style
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings with type hints
- **Testing**: Pytest with 80%+ coverage
- **Code Organization**: Feature-based folder structure

### Cross-Project Learning
The system learns from all your projects:

#### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies successful approaches across projects
- Recognizes your problem-solving patterns
- Tracks technology adoption success rates
- Learns from architectural decisions

#### Knowledge Transfer
- Applies proven solutions to new contexts
- Suggests similar implementations from other projects
- Warns about approaches that caused problems before
- Adapts patterns for different project types

## Common Workflows

### Daily Development Workflow

#### 1. Start Your Session
```bash
# Claude Code automatically loads intelligent context
claude-code --project my-current-project

# System loads:
# ‚úÖ Project-specific context and patterns
# ‚úÖ Recent conversation history
# ‚úÖ Your coding preferences for this project type
# ‚úÖ Cross-project knowledge relevant to current work
```

#### 2. Get Intelligent Suggestions
```bash
# Ask for help with current task
"I need to implement user authentication for this React app"

# System provides:
# üß† Suggestions based on your previous auth implementations
# üîç Code patterns from similar projects
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about approaches that caused issues before
# üöÄ Technology recommendations based on your success patterns
```

#### 3. Learn from Your Work
The system automatically:
- **Tracks Your Decisions**: What technologies you choose and why
- **Monitors Outcomes**: Whether implementations are successful
- **Updates Your Profile**: Evolving understanding of your preferences
- **Improves Suggestions**: Better recommendations over time

### Project Switching Workflow

```bash
# Switch to different project with context transfer
/project-switch web-backend --transfer-patterns

# System automatically:
# ‚úÖ Saves current project context
# ‚úÖ Loads target project context
# ‚úÖ Transfers applicable patterns from current work
# ‚úÖ Provides project-specific intelligent suggestions
```

### New Project Setup Workflow

```bash
# Create project with intelligent setup
/create-intelligent-project
    --name "mobile-app"
    --type "react_native"
    --description "E-commerce mobile application"

# System provides:
# üìã Technology stack recommendations based on your success patterns
# üèóÔ∏è Project structure based on your preferred organization
# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration files matching your established conventions
# üîó Integration patterns from your successful projects
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### MCP Servers Not Starting
```bash
# Check server status
python scripts/check_servers.py

# Common solutions:
# 1. Port conflicts - check if ports 8001-8004 are available
# 2. Database connection - verify database is running
# 3. Dependencies - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Context Not Loading
```bash
# Verify context storage
/context-status --detailed

# Common solutions:
# 1. Restart context storage server
# 2. Check database connectivity
# 3. Verify project initialization completed
```

#### Intelligence Features Not Working
```bash
# Check intelligence engine status
/intelligence-status

# Common solutions:
# 1. Ensure sufficient data (bootstrap at least one project)
# 2. Check if machine learning dependencies are installed
# 3. Verify model training completed successfully
```

#### Poor Suggestion Quality
```bash
# Check developer profile completeness
/profile-status --show-confidence-scores

# Improvement strategies:
# 1. Bootstrap more projects to improve pattern recognition
# 2. Provide feedback on suggestions (accept/reject)
# 3. Ensure projects represent your current preferences
# 4. Check if enough usage data has been collected
```
